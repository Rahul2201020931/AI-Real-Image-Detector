# AI-Real-Image-Detector
AI &amp; Real Image Detector is an intelligent deep learning web app that classifies images as either REAL or AI-generated (DeepFake). Built with TensorFlow and Streamlit, the application leverages a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify subtle patterns and artifacts typically found in AI-generated images.
